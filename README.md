# Hello-World.
Thoughts, Projects, Collaboration
I love gaming and i also enjoy outdoor adventure things, cars, robots, jetpacks. i want to learn to be involved in the programming of machines not just the mechanical engineering side. i want to make them think and move on their own. something like elon musk has achieved, even if on a lesser stage.
